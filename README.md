## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I had a hard time trying to figure out how to have two different
background images and how to position them according to design. I 
also think my solution to the list items could have been done better, but for now it works.


### Continued development

I want to come back to this challenge and redo the list items, to see if I can do it a better way. Using Grid or Flexbox without using two lists.
